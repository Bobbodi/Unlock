## Problem
Singaporean adults face rising stress, burnout, and anxiety, yet many hesitate to seek help due to fear of judgment.  
Modern social platforms often promote curated lifestyles and superficial engagement, leading to unhealthy comparison and emotional isolation.  

This creates a cycle:
- Poor mental well-being → Withdrawal  
- Withdrawal → Isolation  
- Isolation → Heavier emotional burden  

WeShare aims to break this cycle by providing a safe, supportive space for authentic connection.

## Solution
WeShare enables:
- **Thoughts of the Day** – Share how you feel  
- **Question of the Day** – Spark meaningful conversations  
- **Private Chat** – Connect one-to-one based on shared perspectives  

Unlike public discussion forums, WeShare transforms shared opinions into personal conversations.

- Meaningful social connections  
- A safe space to express thoughts
